'''
This node will publish waypoints from the car's current position to some `x` distance ahead.

As mentioned in the doc, you should ideally first implement a version which does not care
about traffic lights or obstacles.

Once you have created dbw_node, you will update this node to use the status of traffic lights too.

Please note that our simulator also provides the exact location of traffic lights and their
current status in `/vehicle/traffic_lights` message. You can use this message to build this node
as well as to verify your TL classifier.

TODO (for Yousuf and Aaron): Stopline location for each traffic light.

Instructions from lesson:

1. First Version 
The goal for the first version of the node should be simply to subscribe to the topics

/base_waypoints & /current_pose

and publish a list of waypoints to /final_waypoints
The /base_waypoints topic publishes a list of all waypoints for the track, 
so this list includes waypoints both before and after the vehicle 
(note that the publisher for /base_waypoints publishes only once). 
For this step in the project, the list published to /final_waypoints should include just a 
fixed number of waypoints currently ahead of the vehicle.

Topic : Msg Type
/base_waypoints : styx_msgs/Lane  
/current_pose  : geometry_msgs/PoseStamped 
/final_waypoints  :  styx_msgs/Lane


2. Final version
Once traffic light detection is working properly, you can incorporate the traffic light data into your waypoint
updater node. To do this, you will need to add a subscriber for the /traffic_waypoint topic and implement the 
traffic_cb callback for this subscriber.

It will be up to you determine what the deceleration should be for the vehicle, 
and how this deceleration corresponds to waypoint target velocities. 
As in the Path Planning project, acceleration should not exceed 10 m/s^2 and jerk should not exceed 10 m/s^3.

Important:
Be sure to limit the top speed of the vehicle to the km/h velocity set by the velocity rosparam in waypoint_loader. 
Reviewers will test on the simulator with an adjusted top speed prior to testing on Carla.
